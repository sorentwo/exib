== TODO

* <init></init>
  - Will run a set of startup items
* Pre-loader
  - Pretty difficult to do, possible with a singleton to count accumulated bytes
    and generate a single bar. Not sure how well it would work with the multi
    packaging ideas.
  - Progress setup in Exib subclass
* Multiple 'group/class'es per node    
* Embedding
  - XML at a minimum
* Explore multiple-package solutions
  - monolithic: Resulting in a single .swf with all assets included
  - micro: A .swf and an open assets folder
  - dat: Two part system, a .swf and a .dat file (.swf really) that includes all
    assets internally
* External Font Loading
  - Because only .ttf files can be embedded Flash IDE is necessary for providing
    suitable fonts. Move to a system where fonts are loaded from a .swf file in
    assets/fonts/fonts.swf
  - http://etcs.ru/pre/FontLoaderDemo/srcview/
  - This removes the last reason to develop within the Flash IDE
* SWF Meta Loading
  - One that works maybe...
  - [SWF(width="650", height="500", frameRate="31", backgroundColor="#FFFFFF")]
* Rake task for 'rake exib:freeze', identical to the rails notion
